# jorge rangel – my setup

(This section was inspired by [The Setup](https://usesthis.com). It's only available in English and it's not in my plans to translate it into Spanish.)

## Who are you and what do you do?

I am Jorge Rangel and I’m a musician, visual artist, multimedia artist and writer. I have collaborated with writers, visual artists, musicians, actors, performance artists, filmmakers, etc. I also coordinate artistic workshops, mostly focused on sound production and multimedia / new media art.

## What hardware do you use?

I use a [MacBook Pro 13” 2012 non-Retina](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i5-2.5-13-mid-2012-unibody-usb3-specs.html) which I got because it’s so much more upgradeable than any other currently available model. I have an [iPod touch 5](http://www.apple.com/es/ipod-touch/) which I use to take pictures, shoot video and sketch music. I just got my first smartphone, a [Samsung J3](http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_j3_(2016)-7760.php) that has a beautiful AMOLED screen and Android Lollypop. I use it to stay connected 24/7, something I resisted for years. I also listen to music and a ton of podcasts.  
For music and sound production I use a [Focusrite Scarlett 2i2](https://us.focusrite.com/usb-audio-interfaces/scarlett-2i2) interface and the [Novation Launchpad Mini](https://global.novationmusic.com/launch/launchpad-mini). I love them both. When I play live (and I rarely do that anymore) I use a [Line 6 FBV Express MkII](http://line6.com/footcontrollers/fbvexpressmkii.html/) foot MIDI controller. I also have a cheap Silvertone Strat-clone-gone-wrong which is enough for me.  
For drawing I use mostly sharpies and a variety of stylographs and pencils, usually on Moleskines, sketchpads or index cards.  
I read on a [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Ereader-ebook-reader/dp/B007HCCNJU/) and get my e-books exclusively from DRM-free distributors.  
Sometimes I take photos and shot video with a not-so-fancy-but-reliable Fujifilm super-zoom camera.  

## And what software?

For music and sound I use [Ableton Live 9](https://www.ableton.com), mainly. Sometimes I also use [SunVox](http://www.warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/) (on both macOS and iOS), [GarageBand](http://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/) (also on macOS and iOS), [Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm) and [Max](https://cycling74.com). I’m trying to learn [Supercollider](http://supercollider.github.io) and [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net).  
For visual and multimedia art I use a variety of tools: [Processing](https://processing.org) for generative visuals and image glitching; Max for processing images and video using Vizzie; [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/mac/) for image editing; [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) and [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/mac/imovie/) for video editing, depending on the complexity of the task at hand. I'm currently getting into [Quartz Composer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_Composer), it's really cool. I also use a lot of apps on my J3 and iPod touch to manipulate images and upload them to [Instagram](http://instagram.com/jarxg).  
I write Markdowon, HTML and CSS in [Atom](https://atom.io) and upload it to [GitHub](https://github.com). [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) turns that into this website.  
I use [the default apps that come with a Mac](http://www.apple.com/osx/apps/): I write on Pages and sometimes Text Edit, check my email accounts on Mail, get organized with a (surprisingly functional) mixture of Calendar / Reminders and [todo.txt](http://www.todotxt.com) (using Simplenote Cloudless on my phone). I organize my photos on... Photos. The integration with Mac OS X and iOS makes using Apple apps a no-brainer for me. I use QuickTime to capture screencasts. I sync everything with iCloud, except for my contacts, which I also sync using Google since I started using an Android phone.  
I listen to music on [cmus](https://cmus.github.io) and sometimes iTunes.  
On my phone I listen to podcasts on Pocket Casts and music on Shuttle. I read using FBReader, browse Reddit with RedReader and comunicate using mostly WhatsApp (which I hate) and Telegram (which I like).  
I keep a journal on [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com), which I love.  
Sometimes I make small programs in [PICO-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).  
I game mostly on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com) but also enjoy NES and SNES games on [OpenEMU](http://openemu.org) and DOS games on [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com).

## What would be your dream setup?

I would love to upgrade my MacBook Pro’s RAM from the stock 4GB to 16GB and ditch the optical drive to get a SSD for the OS and software. Also, a huge display, as big as my computer can handle.  
Other than that, I’m fine, but if my whims were to be satisfied I want a [Launchpad Pro](https://us.novationmusic.com/launch/launchpad-pro#) and [a bigger Scarlett interface](https://us.focusrite.com/usb-audio-interfaces/scarlett-18i8).
I would LOVE to have a [Teenage Engineering OP-1](https://www.teenageengineering.com/products/op-1).  
But yeah, I’m doing fine right now. Oh, I remember one thing: I desperately need a pair of good quality headphones.
