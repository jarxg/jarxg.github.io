title: Embrace chaos
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

My problem is order. I try to give things an order and this attempt at controlling what most of the time is impossible to control prevents me of actually doing things.

This year I decided to embrace chaos, to not be afraid of getting into projects and experiences without a plan. I //can't// plan stuff and I must face it and use that in my favor.
