I just rediscovered TiddlyWiki thanks to [the blog of the late Joe Armstrong](https://joearms.github.io/#Index), the computer scientist best known for creating the Erlang programming language. His blog is made on TiddlyWiki and... that's pretty much it. I might consider taking that road now that I'm in a crossroads with my own blog, trying to decide it's direction.  
A wiki is certainly a flexible platform for blogging and information gathering.
