hello, world! this is a test post for my blog. i just set it up using jekyll in under 30 minutes, all manually and it's already up and running it seems. i haven't implemented tags or anything fancy but it works. maybe later.  
i'm not using time on my page.date tag, so i'll limit myself to one post a day. if eventually i write multiple things in one given day i can implement that in mere minutes, so no big deal.
