Hello, world! This is a test post for my blog. I just set it up using Jekyll in under 30 minutes, all manually and it's already up and running it seems. I haven't implemented tags or anything fancy but it works. Maybe later.  
I'm not using time on my page.date tag, so I'll limit myself to one post a day. If eventually I write multiple things in one given day I can implement that in mere minutes, so no big deal.
