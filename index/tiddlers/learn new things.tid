Sometimes curiosity takes time from actually doing things, so this is a blessing and a curse.

Things I'm learning right now:

* ''~JavaScript'' - Been learning for a long time. Time to really apply myself, I guess. p5.js is the library I use the most.
* ''Processing'' - Same as ~JavaScript. I've been working on some PDFs with printing in mind.
